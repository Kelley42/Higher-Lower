# Higher Lower

This game uses data about famous people and things and asks the player to choose who has the most followers out of two randomly chosen items from the data. 

I added a play again function and the ability to check for incorrect input. I also added functions to check the data to see if the output should be adjusted (changing 'a' to 'an' in a sentence or adding 'the' before United States and United Kingdom) so that the sentence would have correct grammar.
